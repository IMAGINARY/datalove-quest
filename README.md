# Data ❤️ Quest

A game about math, open data and love for the MaRDI Love Data Week 2024.

Based on the interactive exhibit [Citizen Quest](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/citizen-quest), 
developed by [Imaginary](https://about.imaginary.org/) for [Futurium](https://futurium.de/de/citizen-quest).

## Building

Requires Node.js (v18.19 or greater) and npm.
